Images for the dashboard must be copied from a local source to folder on the shiny server for the dashboard to work. We don't want to store the image files on GitHub. 
The following can be run from the host machine to copy to the server (check the folder locations):

scp -r c:/shiny-upload/covid19-dashboard/www/*  shiny@aws-linux:~/apps/covid19-dashboard/shiny/www/
